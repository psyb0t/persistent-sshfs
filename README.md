# `persistent-sshfs` README

Welcome to the chaotic depths of `persistent-sshfs`, where stability meets anarchy, and your SSHFS mounts cling to your server like a rebel to a cause. No more do we bow down to the tyranny of lost connections and manual remounts; `persistent-sshfs` is here to disrupt the status quo.

### What Is This Madness?

`persistent-sshfs` is a bash script for the digital anarchist, a tool that ensures your SSHFS mounts are as persistent as your disdain for authority. It tirelessly checks if your mounts are alive, and if they're not, it revives them like a phoenix from the ashes. And it does all this with the elegance of a cat walking across your keyboard â€“ silently, effectively, and with a touch of chaos.

### Getting Started

To join the revolution, you'll need:

- A Linux machine (the more arcane, the better)
- SSHFS (because that's the whole point)
- Disdain for manual labor (optional but recommended)

#### Installation

TODO

#### Usage

To wield `persistent-sshfs`, you must provide it with a list of mounts, like whispering secrets into the void. Create a file (`mounts.txt`) and inscribe it with your desires:

```
/home/local/dir:user@remote.server:port:/remote/dir
```

Invoke `persistent-sshfs` with the path to your list as a sacrifice:

```sh
./persistent-sshfs mounts.txt
```

And behold as it tirelessly works to maintain your mounts, defying the very laws of connectivity and physics.

### Features

- **Resurrection**: `persistent-sshfs` will continuously check and ensure that all specified mounts are alive and well, reviving any that have fallen.
- **Rebellion Against Passwords**: It refuses to acknowledge mounts that rely on passwords. SSH keys are the only currency it accepts.
- **Anarchy in the Background**: It runs in the shadows, in the background, ensuring your mounts are persistent without bothering your conscious mind.

### Why `persistent-sshfs`?

Because life is too short for manual remounts. Because we believe in automation, in the beauty of a script that does the work for you. And because, in the heart of every sysadmin, there's a little bit of an anarchist waiting to break free.

Join us, and let's make those mounts persistent. Together, we can create a world where no mount ever goes unmounted again. A world of `persistent-sshfs`.
